3. Check words with typos:

There are three types of typos that can be perfomed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings,
write a function to check if they are one typo (or zero typos) away.

Examples:

   pale, ple -> true
   
   pales, pale -> true
   
   pale, bale -> true
   
   pale, bake -> false
